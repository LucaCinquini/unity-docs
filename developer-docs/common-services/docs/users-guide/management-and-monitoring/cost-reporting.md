# Cost Reporting

The Kion dashboard provides a set of tools useful in determining the incurred cost of AWS resources in Unity project accounts.  Below are examples of finding the monthly cost of resources.

1\)  Navigate to the the [Unity Spend Reports](https://login.mcp.nasa.gov/portal/project/125/financials/spend-report) page:



2\)  Select a date range, "Spend by tag" for SPEND VIEW, and one or more tags:

## More Complex Example

One can make more complex cost queries by combining tags in the filters.  For example, we can find the cost associated with resources `CreatedBy` 'sps' in the 'dev' `Venue`:
