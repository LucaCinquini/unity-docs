# Running the app in U-SPS

The demos folder in the unity-analytics-bcdp repo has an example [notebook](https://github.com/unity-sds/unity-analytics-bcdp/blob/main/demo/u-sps-example.ipynb) which describes how to run the application through U-SPS and is heavily adapted from the [tutorial](https://unity-sds.gitbook.io/docs/developer-docs/science-processing/docs/developers-guide/tutorial-execution-of-the-l1b-cwl-workflow-via-the-wps-t-api) in the U-SPS documentation. Note that the API URLs may not work as they are temporary, so consult with the U-SPS team to ensure your URLs are up to date.
