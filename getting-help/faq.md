<summary>When should I contribute to a repository's README versus this doc site?</summary>

Think of a `README.md` as an introduction to a particular module of software and this doc site (i.e. GitBook) as an introduction to the aggregated software experience. Depending on the nature of the software repository hosting the `README.md`, whether a miscellanous tool or an all-encompassing mega-repository, you'll have to decide where to conribute. For the former case, contributing to a `README.md` is usually sufficient - especially if the tool is not core to the software experience and hasn't been described already in this central doc site. For the latter, it is preferable to contribute content (esp. user guides, developer guides, admin guides, feature list, quickstarts, FAQ, contributing guides, etc.) to our central doc site versus individual `README's`. In this case, still make sure to provide links to sections within the `README.md` to relevant areas of this doc site as needed (see [example README.md](https://github.com/unity-sds/unity-architecture#readme)).
